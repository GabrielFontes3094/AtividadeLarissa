        <h2>Belle Ã‰poque
        </h2>
        <p>
            Fashion in this period is marked by luxurious and beautiful clothes, large elaborate hats, lots of feathers and embroidery. The king was known for his appetites, lovers, extravagance and excesses. 
            It was a time of ostentation.
