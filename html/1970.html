        <p>
            A more inviting time, where everything was heavily influenced. 
            Progressive rock and punk rock bands also helped set trends. Skirts, dresses, gowns, bell-bottoms, psychedelic prints and lots of glitter were among the main references of the period. Natural hair, black power, bangs and wavy hair were the trends
