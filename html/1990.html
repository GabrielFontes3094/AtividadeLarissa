    <h2>The 1990s</h2>
    <p>
        The fashion of the 1990s was cheerful, colorful and abused different fabrics, cuts and overlays. There was nothing minimalist about that decade. It was a time of oversize, prints and flashy clothes.
    </p>
    <h2>Nowadays</h2>
    <p>
        fashion is up to everyone, where (theoretically) everyone wears what they feel best in.
