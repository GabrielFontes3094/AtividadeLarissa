        <h2>Era Georgiana</h2>
        <p>Women's clothing was relatively plain, with black predominating, and the fabric naturally dyed. The sewing pattern on the dresses was in the shape of a tunic, with the front decorated with long silver pieces, and the women's outfit was unimaginable without silver accessories. On the head, a double woolen scarf; for layering, a warm cape with false sleeves; on the feet, woolen striped stockings.

        The men's clothing consists of a blouse (mane) and a coat, which looks like a Caucasian tunic. The clothing is decorated with embroidery. Colorful fabrics with appliqu√©s, stripes and crosses. In winter, pachiches were worn to warm and protect the knees, sewn from wool and decorated with embroidery. On the head, a sheepskin hat, typical of shepherds.</p>
