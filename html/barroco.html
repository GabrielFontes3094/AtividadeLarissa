            Rococo is a style characterized by lightness, grace and elegance. In fashion, Rococo means clothes in light, flowing fabrics such as silk and satin. The clothes were fitted to the body and had lots of delicate details, such as ruffles, bows and flowers. The colors were soft and pastel, such as pink, blue and yellow.
